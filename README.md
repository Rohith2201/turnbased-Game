## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A modern web browser.
```
Project deployed at :
```
https://turnbasedgame-git-main-rohith-portfolio.vercel.app/
```

### Downloading the Project
```
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rohith2201/JVLSROHITH_21BCE7494
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hitwicket-assignment/software
   ```

### Installing Dependencies

Install the required Node.js packages using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Server

1. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the game.

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter an `EADDRINUSE` error (address already in use), it means port `8080` is already occupied. You can resolve this by either:

- Stopping the process currently using port `8080` (see the steps below).
- Changing the port in the `server.js` file to another available port (e.g., `8081`).

#### Stopping the Process Using Port 8080

##### On Windows:

1. Find the process using the port:
   ```bash
   netstat -ano | findstr :8080
   ```
2. Kill the process:
   ```bash
   taskkill /PID <PID> /F
   ```

##### On macOS or Linux:

1. Find the process using the port:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :8080
   ```
2. Kill the process:
   ```bash
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```
